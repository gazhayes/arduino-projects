### Countdown Timer
I wanted a countdown timer so that I can see how many days are remaining for various goals/tasks.

This timer counts down a number of days. Days can be hardcoded or sent over serial.

### Pomodoro Machine
This is a Pomodoro timer (google for the Pomodoro Technique). It also includes a stopewatch. Pomodoro time can be set using the variable resistor. Stopwatch and Pomodoro times are added together to show the total time spent in each catagory. Time tracking data is saved to SD card at the end of each day.
